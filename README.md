## The only Warteruzannan you know ðŸ˜„.

- I'm a Brazilian software developer passionate about solving complex problems with simple solutions. Currently, I work at Intelipost as a Backend Engineer. I graduated in Computer Science at Federal University of GoiÃ¡s and  I obtained my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar) in 2020. Currently,I'm a Ph.D. student at UFSCar. I have experience in mobile/web development, machine learning, and software architecture.
Currently, my studies are focused on software architecture, patterns in microservices, and how to develop highly scalable applications using this type of architecture.

- Corintiano and AraÃ§uense.
